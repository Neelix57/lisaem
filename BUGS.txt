Here's a list of some of the current known issues, there are likely many others.

* Terminal code isn't complete - menus don't work, Xmodem isn't complete.
* serial port A is broken on Lisa Office System so it's disabled by default
* UniPlus + Xenix still don't fully boot.
* MacWorks XL 3.0 sometimes works, other times crashes.

* Various sound generation issues across several platforms, but works on 
GTK if SDL is enabled, so turning on SDL for build wx scripts. 

* Mouse tracking fails to work under high load throttle- noticed on GTK.
On my system when using a debug compiled binary and throttle set to 100MHz,
Lisa Office System does not recognize mouse movement except for clicks.
Seems to be a wxWidgets related issues where mouse movements are treated
as lower priority without clicks and are not sent. Lowering the CPU throttle
to 48MHz fixes this, YMMV. The OnMouseMove method is no longer called by the
event handler.
The symptom appears to ignore mouse up events in LOS, and every click is
a drag.

* Install both Xcode and command line tools on macos x.
to properly build wxWidgets on macos x, it's highly recommended to install the
right version of Xcode for your os as well as the right version of the Command
line tools that match that Xcode. Builds with just command line tools don't
install the macos SDKs which then fail when you try to compile LisaEm
against wxWidgets.

* If you get a  fatal error: 'tr1/type_traits' file not found  error, run this (Change the filename as needed)
sudo patch /usr/local/wx3.1.2-cocoa-x86-macOS-10.9-clang-sdl/include/wx-3.1/wx/strvararg.h  scripts/wx-strvararg.patch

Only has to be done once.

* UPX on macos 10.8, 10.9 generates executables that segfault, do not use.
Added code to the bashbuild scripts to disable it on those, possibly affects
other macos x versions, based on old memories, I remember it working on PPC32/64
on macos 10.4, not sure about 10.5-10.7. This also affects command line tools
such as lisafsh-tool.

* blu-to-dc42
This code does not work well enough to convert Widget or Profile dumped via BLU
to be bootable, nor mountable in LisaEm, although lisafsh-tool can get a 
directory of the resulting image, not yet sure what's wrong.

* dc42-to-tar not yet complete - contains bugs
