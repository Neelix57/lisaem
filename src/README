LisaEm source code has been modified to mostly match the actual organization
of a real Lisa.  Of course, not all of the dirs here have a purpose.  Some
are here for, ornamental reasons.

The idea is to structure the source code tree in the same manner as an actual
physical Lisa as much as possible.


host			- Host OS related files

include			- common header files (links are used to the libs)

lib			- libraries such as libGenerator and dc42

lisa/cpu_board		- sources related to the Lisa's CPU board
lisa/crt		- the display (placeholder)
lisa/expansion_slots	- source code related to the expansion slots
lisa/floppy		- source code related to the IWM/6504 floppy controller
lisa/io_board		- source code related to the I/O board (VIA, SIO, COPS, etc.)
lisa/keyboard		- keyboard table
lisa/memory		- memory boards (placeholder)
lisa/motherboard	- sources associated with motherboard devices (common C files)
lisa/power_supply	- placeholder
lisa/video_board	- placeholder

printer			- source code that emulated printers (ImageWriter/AMDP)

storage			- hard drive storage devices (profile.c)

tools			- various Lisa related tools (lisafsh-tool, lisadiskinfo, etc.)
